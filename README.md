# OneWordStories
"Social media" website where users can create stories one word at a time.

## Technologies used
### Tauri
This project was built using tauri, which is a rust electron alternative which runs a react frontend. 

### Rust
Part of the Tauri wrapper, of course this rust code is probably not the most efficent in the world as it's the first time i've ever used the language.

### React
Used react to build the frontend, this time utilizing functional components with JSX.
## Why I made this project
This project does not have much pratical use, nor do I see it as ever being used by an actual userbase. I did however, see this as a good opportunity to learn rust, as well as have some fun implementing what I thought was a cool idea.
